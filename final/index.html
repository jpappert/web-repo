  <p>
I am a junior Strategic Communications major (with an emphasis in media design) and a Creative Technology and Design minor. <br>Previously studying as a Fine Arts major, my focus now lies in a profound love for communication. I have a unique affinity for creativity, human connection, and collaboration. I find satisfaction in being a free thinker and striving for goals some may say are impossible. With large aspirations for the future, I can seamlessly incorporate my ambitions into any work environment. I value open-mindedness and am never afraid to face any challenge with determination and persistence.<br>

I am certified in Microsoft Excel and fluent in various artistic mediums, such as Photoshop, Procreate, and all traditional art. <br> I am comfortable coding in HTML and CSS. <br> I collect and analyze data, design, and assist social media accounts for Magnet Muze, an online art and journalism publication.<br> I am a theatre lover, participating in multiple roles, ranging from an ensemble member at David Geffen Hall (Broadway) to participating on a collegiate improv team on campus.<br> I have a deep passion for humanitarian causes, as well as awareness of intersectional social issues. <br>I am devoted to advocating for the less fortunate, equality, and empowering marginalized communities. A novel combination of soft and hard skills differentiates me from any other individuals in my field, and I can't wait to apply my talent to any job setting. My long-term goal to work in strategic communications drives me to do better every day. I am consistent in my core values reflected in my work: empathy, creativity, and strategy.</p>
