Gabriel García Márquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude","A rat in a maze is free to go anywhere, as long as it stays inside the maze - Margaret Atwood, The Handmaid's Tale","But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me - Madeline Miller, Circe","And perhaps it is the greater grief, after all, to be left on earth when another is gone.-Madeline Miller, The Song of Achilles", "How brave it is to love something death can touch", "Night falls; the traveler must pass down village streets, between the houses with yellow- lit windows, and on out into the darkness of the fields. Each alone, they go west or north, towards the mountains. They go on. They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas. -Ursula K. Le Guin, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"];
